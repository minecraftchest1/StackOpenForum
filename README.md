# StackOpenForum
An open source forum software based on Stack Exchange written in C# and .net core.

The goal of this project is to make an open source forum software that users that have used [stack exchange](https://stackexchange.com) will reconize.
This project is being worked on in my spare time. Pull requests are welcome.

# Notice
I am caneling this project as I have not put much work into it. I am also going to branch out into two repros if I continue.
